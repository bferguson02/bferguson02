    "For this assignment, I took a picture with a specific phrase written on it and turned it into a NumPy array of RGB values.  I then transformed that array using a set of specific NumPy transformations.  It will be your task to transform the array back to the original by performing the same NumPy transformations.  In the end, you will reshape the array and show the corresponding image associated with it. Your notebook will then be uploaded to CodeGrade to check your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please make sure you follow all the steps <u>*in order*</u> or the picture may not be viewable and the question may be counted incorrect in CodeGrade.\n",
    "- Since these operations must be done in order on the data, you MUST use the variable from the previous question when performing the operation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **SampleQ1:** Create a variable called SampleQ1 that is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "       SampleQ1 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   **SampleQ2:** Add 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "      SampleQ2 = SampleQ1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   **SampleQ3:** Multiply by 2\n",
    "\n",
    "      SampleQ3 = SampleQ2 * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could probably see the phrase before you completed all the steps even though it might be fuzzy. Try to resist the temptation to peak at the picture until you are done. The goal of this task is to give you practice working with NumPy.\n",
    "- Make sure that your notebook is saved with the name `picture_phrase` before submitting to CodeGrade.\n"
